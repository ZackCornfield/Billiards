# Billiards

This Billiards game was a group project I did in my second year of university. We used OpenGL C to create a functioning Billiards game that required us to implement the appropriate physics/maths in order to create a realistic game. 

## How to Run

To run the Billiards Game, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Executable Folder**: 
   - You can download the Executable Folder directly from the project's GitHub repository.

2. **Run the exe file in the folder**:
  - Double click on the file to run

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions**:
   - Once the program is running, follow the prompts and enjoy the game
